# ADVANCED HOUSING DATASET

The dataset was used to learn EDA, feature selection and feature engineering in the beginning stages of studying ml. 


# STEPS IN EDA:

1. HANDLE MISSING VALUES
2. FIND ALL THE NUMERICAL VALUES
3. DISTRIBUTION OF ALL NUMERICAL VALUES
4. FIND ALL CATEGORICAL VALUES
5. CARDINALITY OF ALL CATEGORICAL VALUES
6. OUTLIERS
7. RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INDEPENDENT AND DEPENDENT VALUES


# STEPS IN FEATURE ENGINEERING:

1. FIX MISSING VALUES
2. TEMPORAL VARIABLES(Date&Time)
3. CATEGORICAL VARIABLES
4. STANDARDIZE THE VALUES


# FEATURE SELECTION:

Lasso regression was used to select the features which had most impact on the housing prices.
